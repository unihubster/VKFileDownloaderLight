# VK File Downloader

## Main purpose
This is Java console application.
It can find and download or just collect links to attached files
from a social network VKontakte in topics, wall or hashtag search
which are opened to access without authentication.

The application can be packaged by Maven to .jar with dependencies.
You can find built application in the current folder.
Its name is VKFileDownloaderLight-0.7.3-jar-with-dependencies.jar.
You can run the application on your Windows PC with preinstalled Java version 8 (1.8) or higher
if you download both file VKFileDownloaderLight-0.7.3-jar-with-dependencies.jar and VKFileDownloaderLight-0.7.3.bat,

### Remark
This is my old project for my fried. It was developed in 2018.
It will be great to refactor it but not now.
